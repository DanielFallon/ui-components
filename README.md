  render () {
    return (
      <MyComponent />
    )
  }
}
```

## Publishing

When you are ready to publish a new version of ui-components, we recommend the [np](https://github.com/sindresorhus/np) package.  Follow the directions on the site, and and your new version should be published directly to GitHub, and viewable from the [releases](https://github.com/project44/ui-components/releases) page of this repo.

- [ ] make sure you have `np` installed `npm install --global np`
- [ ] run `yarn build` to generate the static assets
- [ ] run `np <version>` or `yarn publish`
  - Version can be: `patch | minor | major | prepatch | preminor | premajor | prerelease | 1.2.3`
